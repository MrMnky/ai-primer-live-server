    title: 'Where we\'ve been',
    body: `<p>We started with what AI is. How it actually works. What it's good at. What it's not.</p>
<p>We talked about where it creates value — and equally important, where it creates risk.</p>
<p>We looked at what it means for your strategy, your team, the work you do every day.</p>
<p>And we've walked through how to actually apply it. Not with buzzwords. With techniques that work.</p>`,
    notes: `Quick arc of the course. Don't linger — this is a reminder, not a recap. Energy is reflective, slightly warm. You're acknowledging the ground you've covered together.`,

    title: 'The real work starts after today.',
    body: '<p>Everything we\'ve talked about only matters if you do something different with it next week. Next month. Something concrete. Something you\'ll actually do.</p>',
    notes: `Pause before and after. This is the pivot from learning to action. Not dismissive of what came before — it validates it by saying "now make it real."`,

      placeholder: 'e.g. Record myself thinking through a problem and transcribe it...',
    },
    notes: `This is a moment of genuine reflection, not rhetorical. Give it space. Offer examples: "Record yourself thinking out loud and transcribe it. Ask AI to do research you've been putting off. Run a comparison of vendors you've been considering." But something concrete. Something you'll actually do.`,

    title: 'Three months from now',
    body: `<p>If you do one small thing differently next week, and build on it, three months from now you'll be using AI in ways you can't quite imagine yet.</p>
<p><strong>Habits compound.</strong> Small experiments become capabilities. Capabilities compound into advantage.</p>`,
    callout: {
      title: 'AI advantage',
      body: 'AI advantage won\'t come from knowing more than others. It will come from better judgement, better habits, and better timing.',
    },
    notes: `Encouraging without being hype-y. The compound metaphor is the engine of this slide. "Habits compound" should land clearly. The callout — judgement over knowledge — is the thesis of the entire course distilled into one line.`,
  },

    type: 'statement',

    title: 'That judgement is the asset. Not the technology. Not the tool. The thinking.',
    body: '<p>You\'re capable of far more with AI than you probably think right now. And you\'re more thoughtful about the risks than most people are. That\'s a good place to be.</p><p>Go build something.</p>',
    notes: `The final slide. Warm, confident, grounded. "Go build something" is the last line — deliver it with quiet conviction. This should feel like a colleague you trust giving you permission to move forward. Energy: calm and slightly energised.`,
